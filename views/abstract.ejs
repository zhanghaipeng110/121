                Riley started out as musician and street performance
                artist, and now blends painting and photography with
                audio, video, and computer multimedia to create what
                he calls 'Music and Multimedia Artworks.' Riley's
                innovations in using multimedia to express art have
                created a youth culture movement in his town of
                Portland, in which he remains at the forefront.
                In his role as the founder of the MMA art form,
                Riley has become an inspiration to many up and coming
                artists. However, the part Riley insists is most
                important to him, is that he's helped many troubled
                youth take control of their lives, and create their own
                unique, positive futures. Seeing kids he's mentored
                graduate from high school and enroll in college, gives
                art the purpose that Riley so craves.

            <p>A first-year student at the Roux Academy of Art,
                Media, and Design, Riley is already changing the face
                of modern art at the university. Riley's exquisite
                abstract pieces have no intention of ever being
                understood, but instead beg the viewer to dream,
                create, pretend, and envision with their mind's eye.
                Riley will be speaking on the 'Art of Abstract' during
                Thursday's schedule.
